#### Description:
My team and I approached this project with the goal of creating a game that would stand out from others. We decided on a stealth based 2.5D comedy game, aiming for something unique and different. You can find a more detailed breakdown about the game in our Game Design Document, which is available through this <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/All-Jams-And-Hackathons/blob/main/Open%20Source%20Jams/Pirate%20Software%20Game%20Jam%2016/Game%20Design%20Document.pdf">link</a>.

Overall, I'm very proud of the work I contributed. I learned a lot throughout the process, especially from the more experienced members of the team. In particular, the professional lead technical artist who helped me improve my programming skills, deepen my Unity knowledge, and become more familiar with Unity tooling.

I've also uploaded the full project repo to the Open Source Jams folder in this repository.

This game does have a few problems primarily with the player controller, camera controller, final navmesh baking and with hijacking enemies in the tutorial. The problem aspects with these mechanics were assigned to our technical artist, but they were ultimately not resolved.

#### Key Challenges:

Managing A Large Team [5 People]

Unity AI

Enumberable State Machine

Learning About Unity Tooling

Learning Deeper Knowledge Of Unity

Using Scriptable Objects

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Trello

Made with Unity using C#

#### Impact on me:
I gained deeper knowledge of team management, team collaboration and more knowledge of unity and c# due to working with a professional lead technical artist

![2D](https://img.shields.io/badge/Style-2D-green)
![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-CSharp-2c2d72)

#### Description:
I wanted to make a basic 2D, retro arcade style game for this game jam. I was heavily limited given the nature of this game jam being you're only allowed to use a single button as the input for the game but I believed I managed to pull it off without it being to much of a hinderance

#### Key Challenges:
The key challenges I faced in this game jam was that I struggled in trying to make a menu navigation system only using one button, I overcame this by designing the system I used, press space to go down, double click space to select, hold and release space to go up. It could be better by having more feedback to the player for when the player is holding the spacebar down with some sort of UI element displaying when holding down the space bar (e.g. a fill bar)

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Made with Unity using C#

#### Impact on me:
I gained more game design / game design problem solving skills given the very limiting nature of the theme of this game jam.

![Blueprints](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Blueprints-2c2d72)

#### Description:
I learned a lot from this game jam, I used C++ Interfaces to allow for easier control over what can be accessed by levers and what can be accessed by pressure plates, using polymorphism so it always calls the same function on those interfaces, so when a lever is pulled it will always call whatever object i decide to give that specific lever access to through a variable, on that object it will have the C++ interface for levers so it will call the "lever open" function. Same goes for pressure plates. This way means that I can easily make new objects for either levers or pressure plates to interact with easily by making that object implement that specific interface.

I have found that some people had performance issues, I thought I covered this issue by using the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Settings/RunHardwareBenchmark">Run Hardware Benchmark</a> node and then using the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Settings/ApplyHardwareBenchmarkResults">Apply Hardware Benchmark Results</a> node on every level's BeginPlay node, however this seems to of not been enough according to some of the comments I recieved unfortunatly. What I would do in the future is have more in depth settings or maybe have graphical settings automatically be applied if the player's FPS is not at 60.

#### Key Challenges:
The key challenges I face was figuring out how C++ interfaces work within Unreal Engine 5

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Made with Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints

#### Impact on me:
I gained skills in learning how C++ interfaces work within Unreal Engine 5 and improving Unreal Engine 5 workflow using C++ interfaces. I also gained puzzle crafting skills with designing the puzzles for this game.

![Blueprints](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Blueprints-2c2d72)

#### Description:
I wanted to do a jam with Unreal Engine 5 because I wanted to use my new found knowledge from developing Unreal Engine 5 tech demos which can be found <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Small-Unreal-Engine-5-Tech-Demos">here</a>. I decided to collaborate with a friend of mine in this jam as this is my first time doing a jam using Unreal Engine 5 and having help from another person would prove to be very helpful. My friend was very new to Unreal Engine 5 and had to download it to use in this jam, I also had to teach him the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 5 but he was very helpful with the programming after I taught him the basics. He also did the level design for the first level too.

#### Key Challenges:
Teaching another person Unreal Engine 5 and how to use the game engine at the fundamental level.

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Made with Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints

![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Lua-2c2d72)

#### Description:
I wanted to try out a different game engine to just try something new. I decided this jam would be a good idea because it is a build jam making a technical asset for other people using Crayta to use. Crayta is an engine I was originally completely unfamiliar with and uses a language that I don't use regularly so I thought this would be a good challenge.

#### Key Challenges:
Learning the workings of an engine completely unfamiliar to me and having to develop a tool for it that is easy to use and pick up.

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Made with the Crayta Game Engine using Lua

#### Impact on me:

![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Engine-Unity-57b9f7)
![2D](https://img.shields.io/badge/Style-2D-green)
![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-CSharp-2c2d72)

#### Description:
This game is a bit of a mess due to some unfortunate circumstances, as he is known on itch.io, Yacob had to leave his computer for three days at the start of the jam and that resulted in me doing the game jam solo for 3 days, I did all the main functionality for the game and withheld myself to not do the majority of the game because I wanted Yacob to take part in the game also and he did aswell. 

After he returned back to his computer my internet went offline for the remainder of the Jam and I couldn't really help Yacob with the game manually and had to talk to him to help in any way I really could since he is new to game development. He continued programming new aspects of the game and understanding and altering code I made whilst also working on other aspects of the game. This resulted in us not being able to produce a proper game for the game jam.

I feel the way I handled the situation of not being able to properly work on this together was good because I communicated with him what needed to be done but all the things that i communcated to him (explain to the player how to play, what's going on, how to win etc) weren't properly implemented or weren't at all implemented. This is no fault of his own as he is very new to Unity but this was a good experience for me to have on how to deal with roadblocks like this so I'm better equipped and experienced for the future if this or something similar to this happens again.

#### Key Challenges:
Technical Issues with Internet connectivity

Collaborator being not able to work on the game for 3 days

Collaborating with a new game developer without being able to have a stable internet connection so I couldn't help the new developer directly

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Made with the Unity Game Engine using C#

#### Impact on me:
Improved team skills

Improved problem solving skills

#### Description:
I wanted to take part in this as it was a unique jam where you are given a starter project to continue and improve aswell as it being a much longer game jam then the ones I have done previous which gives me time to do more of a full project

Since this was a longer jam and I was given very detailed feedback, I uploaded the source code and gave a detailed summary of what I have learned from this on the Search For A Star 2022 repository which can be found <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Search-For-A-Star-2022">here</a>

#### Description:
I wanted to make a different type of game with a different change of pace. I aimed to make a game where you can go at your own pace with no real objective, more of a sandbox and I think I accomplished this goal with this game. I did not position too well on this Jam and I think it is for several reasons, main one being I only focused on the core mechanic which made it so i score relatively well in the fun category, I positioned poorly everywhere else.

What I learned from this is to not tunnel vision on one key aspect of the game to ensure the game is good in all aspects.

#### Key Challenges:
Making a different style of game

#### Tools&Tech Used:
Made with the Unity Game Engine using C#

#### Impact on me:
Learning not to tunnel vision on one element of the game and to focus on every aspect of the game instead.

#### Description:
Not strictly a game jam but this was in essence a game jam as we were given a theme and we decided to make a game with the theme so it's basically a game jam. This game is a bit of a mess but this was a really fun experience, the majority of my teammates have never touched Unity before and the other was a first year game dev student. So what I decided to do was become the project leader as I have found throughout my University experience and game jam experience that I like being in a managerial role / Project leader making the decisions on what the game is going to be and what the next step is. You can find more of a breakdown on how this whole experience was for me in the link provided along with the password to access the page

#### Description:
This was a really good game for me, I wanted to become more independant in me making games, as in, I wanted to the whole process myself from making models, music and sound effects all by myself which I was unsuccesful in but I did the majority of the assets. I also wanted to explore more aspects of unity which is why the game looks the way it does. I wanted to look into a bunch of different things in Unity. I believe I was successful in making a good game too and I am proud of my work.

I have also learned the importance of being able to customize game more (editing mouse sensitivity, enabling/disabling motion blur) to lower the bar to entry for my games in the future and give a more enjoyable experience all around.

#### Key Challenges:
Making all the assets myself

Learning tools used to make sound effects, background music and 3D models

#### Description:
We treated this as a 48 hour game jam as that fitted our schedules the best and the person I was working with on this was doing the programming, because I wanted to better and practice my 3D modelling and audio abilities, he and I both wanted to learn how car physics work so he watched a youtube tutorial and figured it out and wrote a script following the tutorial. On the second day, he had some unforeseen issues he had to deal with in real life so I did the majority of the programming when I was not expecting to. It was thrown together last second and I could not refine it as much as I wanted to so it turned into a semi complete jam game, but I feel the idea is there.

#### Key Challenges:
Learning car physics

Collaborator having to leave on the 2nd day of the jam

#### Tools&Tech Used:

#### Description:
After two failed attempts in exploring an idea I had, one was a game where you had to make the character complete a level by completing an IF statement, this was scrapped due to it not being fun to play, the second was going to be a 3D game, I eventually took the obvious idea of two playable characters just so I could submit something but I did want to explore having two controllable characters anyway but due to the angle I took this game wasn't the most creative take on the theme I enjoyed learning about how to make a grappling hook and after the Jam i learnt how to make it work properly so it latches onto objects I want it to latch onto.

#### Description:
I wanted to try to make a game inspired from My Friend Pedro and put my own take on it, my take on the game was it being focused around cats and in an 8bit format with Jump Pads and no slow down ability to make it more hectic, i don't think my execution on this was well done, I think the appearance of the game is quite boring and the mechanics feel clunky, more polish on this is much needed and If i polished this more i believe it would be a better game.

#### Description:
This was my first collobarative game jam, I had a good time working on this one although we had to alter the art style drastically due to not finding the art assets we wanted. We wanted the art to be inside of a shopping mall and have to knock over other pedestrians who get in the players way and potential take their gifts. After this game jam I have been trying to learn how to do other aspects of game development so I don't have to make sacrifices to the game like this.
